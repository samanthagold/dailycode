-- level: easy 
    -- might be time to try some medium level questions??

-- order all countries by the year they first participated in the Olympics
-- NOC | Year 
-- sorted by year and NOC in ascending order 



-- my solution 
SELECT MIN(YEAR) as first_time_year, 
       noc
FROM olympics_athletes_events
GROUP BY noc 
ORDER BY first_time_year, noc


-- proposed solution 
    -- same as my solution
