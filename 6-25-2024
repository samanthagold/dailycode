-- level: easy 
-- key detail: data cleaning carefulness shown (aka null values needed to be converted to 0 before summing)



-- solution 

SELECT user_id, 
       SUM(cleaned.listen_duration)/60 AS total_listen_duration, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT cleaned.song_id) AS unique_song_count
FROM 
(SELECT user_id, 
        CASE 
            WHEN listen_duration IS NULL THEN 0 
            ELSE listen_duration
        END AS listen_duration, 
        song_id
 from listening_habits) AS cleaned
GROUP BY user_id

-- attempt 1 
select user_id, 
       SUM(listen_duration) AS total_listen_duration, -- need alias included here + divide by 60 
       COUNT(song_id) AS unique_song_count            -- need alias here 
FROM 
(select user_id, 
        CASE 
            WHEN listen_duration IS NULL THEN 0 
            ELSE listen_duration
        END AS listen_duration, 
        song_id
 from listening_habits) -- missing alias 
GROUP BY user_id




-- random lessons
    -- COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) will ignore NULL values because NULL is not considered a distinct value 
    -- COUNT(DISTINCT ...) can be slower compared to COUNT(*) because it requires sorting and removing     duplicates to find the unique values 
    -- syntax for partitioning: 

    select user_id, 
           SUM(cleaned.listen_duration) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS total_listen_duration 
    from listening_habits
