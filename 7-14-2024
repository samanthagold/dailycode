-- notes
    -- initially wanted to use window function, but realized you needed to aggrgate two columns together
    -- when should i use window functions and when should i aggregate? 
        -- depends on the output that you want...
        -- if you want to reduce the number of rows (i.e. the level of output dataset is less than the input) then use GROUP BY
