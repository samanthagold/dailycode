-- 6/26/24
-- level: easy 
-- stage_of_order | week | quantity 
-- expected output: week | quantity 


-- my solution 
SELECT SUM(cleaned.quantity) AS quantity, 
       cleaned.week
FROM(
    SELECT stage_of_order, 
        week, 
        quantity, 
        EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM week) AS quarter
    FROM orders_analysis
    ) AS cleaned
WHERE quarter = 1
GROUP BY week


-- alternative solutions 
SELECT week, 
       SUM(quantity)
FROM orders_analysis 
WHERE extract(QUARTER FROM week) = 1 AND EXTRACT(year FROM week) = 2023 
GROUP BY week 


-- notes 
    -- reminded about EXTRACT(DATETYPE FROM varname) syntax 
    -- reminded WHERE comes before GROUP BY 
    -- would probably be a good idea to work on saying these things out loud while doing them to get better at showing your thought process. 
    -- got lucky in my solution - needed to restrict to 2023 only
