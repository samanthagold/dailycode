-- level: medium
-- notes: 
    -- tried a previous meta question but it was too hard will go back to that one later 
    -- identifies cities with higher than average home prices when compared to the national average 
    -- output: city_names
    -- zillow_transactions: id | state| city | street_address | mkt_price 
    -- need to figure out the national average market price

-- proposed solution 

with city_avg as (
    select 
        city, 
        avg(mkt_price) AS city_avg
    from 
        zillow_transactions
    group by city
)


select distinct 
    city 
from 
    city_avg
where city_avg > (select avg(mkt_price) from zillow_transactions)


-- notes: 
    -- personally: i think this is cleaner than a lot of what is out there. 
    -- a lot of the solutions use the "HAVING" clause 
    -- HAVING: added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions
    -- ordering
        -- SELECT 
        -- FROM
        -- WHERE
        -- GROUP BY 
        -- HAVING
        -- ORDER BY 
    -- cannot use HAVING with window functions either only with aggregate functions 
    -- most likely to use with a GROUP BY statement
