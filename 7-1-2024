    -- problem: a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a flight's duration
    -- details: 
        -- flight 1010 only 
        -- runtime <= flight duration 
    -- output: flight_id | movie_id | movie_duration 




-- my solution 
with cleaned as (
select * from entertainment_catalog 
INNER JOIN flight_schedule AS sched
ON flight_id = sched.flight_id
WHERE flight_id = 101
)

select flight_id, 
       movie_id, 
       duration AS movie_duration 
from cleaned 
where duration <= flight_duration


-- notes: 
    -- re-figuring out INNER JOIN syntax on SQL 
    -- renaming a column is as simple as doing og_columnname AS new_columnname 


-- proposed solution 
SELECT
    fs.flight_id,
    ec.movie_id,
    ec.duration AS movie_duration
FROM
    flight_schedule fs
JOIN
    entertainment_catalog ec ON ec.duration <= fs.flight_duration
WHERE
    fs.flight_id = 101  -- Specify the flight ID here
ORDER BY
    ec.duration;

-- notes: 
    -- like the way this is structured 
    -- doing a join to figure out to exclude movies that do not meet criteria
    -- cleaner solution
