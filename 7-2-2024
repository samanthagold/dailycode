-- level: easy 
-- problem: restrict to last_name = 'Johnson' 
-- time needed to complete: 2:00 


-- my solution
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    last_name
FROM
    employee_list
WHERE 
    LOWER(last_name) = 'johnson' AND 
    profession = `Doctor`
    
-- notes
    -- the system doesn't like my answer because it includes other Johnsons in the database but I think my solution is more complete  
    -- read the question carefully to make sure you aren't missing any details...the error that you made here was from you not filtering things correctly 


-- problem #2
-- note: above problem was too simple so started another one 
-- time: 14:02


-- proposed solution 
-- absolute difference in salaries 
-- one table at the db_employee level 
-- one table at the db_dept level 
with intermediate as (

    select *, 
           MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as maxsal 
    from db_employee e 
    inner join db_dept d
    ON e.department_id = d.id
    WHERE department IN ('marketing', 'engineering') 

)

select * from intermediate

-- solution part 2: 
with prepped as(
    SELECT
        DISTINCT MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS maxsal
    FROM 
        db_employee emp
    INNER JOIN 
        db_dept dpt
    ON emp.department_id = dpt.id
    WHERE
        department IN ('marketing', 'engineering')
        
)

select ABS(max(maxsal) - min(maxsal))
FROM prepped

-- I think there is an even cleaner way to do this...
