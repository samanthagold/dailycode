-- level: medium
-- original table: unique at the feedback_id level 
    -- feedback_id | feedback_text | source_channel | comment_category 
-- output table: 
    -- feedback_id | feedback_text | source_channel| calculated category 



-- solution 
select distinct
    feedback_id, 
    feedback_text, 
    source_channel, 
    comment_category 
from 
    customer_feedback
where 
    comment_category != 'short_comments' 
    AND 
    source_channel = 'social_media'   

-- notes
    -- not super complicated of a question 
    -- questions at the beginning that you would like to ask: 
        -- [a] can i assume that the table is unique at the feedback_id level? 
        -- [b] can i assume that there are no discrepancies/data errors the data entries of the team? 
        -- [c] is it correct to assume that there are only three categories?
